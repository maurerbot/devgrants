# Open Grant Proposal: `IPSG`

**Name of Project: IPSG - Interplanetary Semantic Graph**

**Proposer:** `maurerbot`

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP and dual-license under MIT and APACHE2 licenses?:** Yes

# Project Description

Pinning content on IPFS is very easy however, indvidual users need to track and maintain a list of CIDs and thier contents. This isn't a very convenient user experience and limits how quickly IPFS can be adopted.

IPFS is missing a transportable semantic layer that provides an open ontology of content for users, plugins, and other systems. With this semantic layer, built on top of IPLD, content can be organized into a graph and partitioned for individual users or groups of users for discoverability and collaboration.

Once applied, this content can facilitate novel ways of working.

## Value

Please describe in more detail why this proposal is valuable for the IPFS ecosystem. Answer the following questions:
- What are the benefits to getting this right?
- What are the risks if you don't get it right?
- What are the risks that will make executing on this project difficult?

This section should be 1-3 paragraphs long.

Early value of a semantic layer on IPFS would, at the very least, improve the user experience for individuals by providing a familar way of storing and retrieving content bound to their context. Within their context, users can describe content in arbitrary ways including relationships that link off to other content creating a semantic graph. 

These graphs can be exported and imported across contexts meaning, overtime, a global ontology will begin to emerge.

The content is described by the user is also made searchable    This action of exporting enables 


## Deliverables

Please describe in details what your final deliverable for this project will be. Include a specification of the project and what functionality the software will deliver when it is finished.

## Development Roadmap

Please break up your development work into a clear set of milestones. This section needs to be very detailed (will vary on the project, but aim for around 2 pages for this section).

For each milestone, please describe:
- The software functionality that we can expect after the completion of each milestone. This should be detailed enough that it can be used to ensure that the software meets the specification you outlined in the Deliverables.
- How many people will be working on each milestone and their roles
- The amount of funding required for each milestone
- How much time this milestone will take to achieve (using real dates)

## Total Budget Requested

Sum up the total requested budget across all milestones, and include that figure here. Also, please include a budget breakdown to specify how you are planning to spend these funds.

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

Specify your team's long-term plans to maintain this software and upgrade it over time.
